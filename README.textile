h1. Rails Templater

Rails Templater is a gem which generates new Ruby on Rails 3 applications the way you want them. Based on your choices, Rails Templater will create an application configured correctly. For example, if you select Mongoid for an ODM and RSpec for your testing framework, Rails Templater will generate all necessary hooks to handle dropping your collections from MongoDB. The project was inspired by ffmike's "BigOldRailsTemplate":http://github.com/ffmike/BigOldRailsTemplate Rails 2 template project.
